🎓 College Management System – Data Project (SQL Based)

📌 Introduction
This project is a comprehensive College Management System built with SQL to simulate real-life academic data management. It aims to reflect how a university like Syracuse University organizes, stores, and tracks data for students, professors, courses, and academic progress. The system includes relational tables and sample data covering key academic entities and operations.

🧾 Project Description
This project models and manages data for a college’s academic operations using SQL. It demonstrates the schema design, table creation, data insertion, and use cases like tracking course enrollment, faculty assignments, course completions, and performance analytics.

It simulates realistic data flow in an academic institution and can be extended for dashboards, reporting, and machine learning use cases.

🎯 Problem Statement
Academic institutions need to manage vast amounts of interconnected data involving students, professors, courses, terms, and results. Manual tracking is inefficient, error-prone, and non-scalable.

The objective is to:

Design a normalized relational database schema.

Represent realistic data for multiple academic entities.

Enable queries for performance tracking, faculty allocation, course history, etc.

📚 What the Project Covers
🗃️ Database Design
Entities: Student, Professor, Course, Term, Professor-Course Assignment, Course Completion

Relationships:

Many-to-Many (Professors to Courses via professor_course)

Many-to-Many (Students to Courses via course_completion)

One-to-Many (Courses offered in Terms)

🛠️ SQL Features Demonstrated
Table creation with constraints (PK, FK)

Data population (30 students, 30 courses, 10+ professors, 5 terms)

Foreign key relationships and normalization

Joins across tables for meaningful queries

📊 Sample Operations Enabled
Retrieve all courses completed by a student with grades

List professors teaching in a given term

Calculate average grade for each course

List students with top performance

Generate course completion rates per term
